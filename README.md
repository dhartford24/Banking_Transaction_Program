# Banking_Transaction_Program

Created a mock banking program to simulate a user's bank account.  In this program the user was displayed the total amount in their bank account from both their checking and savings accounts.  The user is then prompted to deposit or withdraw money from one of their accounts.  The program is also user friendly, and does not allow the user to overdraw from either account. It also incorporates a checking fee and adds an interest payment to the savings account.
